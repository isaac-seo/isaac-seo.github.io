I am a graduate student at Seoul National University, advised by Prof. Yongsoo Song. 

My research interest lies in (but is not limited to) the practical instantiation of cryptographic protocols using techniques from lattice-based cryptography. 

Specifically, my recent research focuses on improving the performance of lattice-based proof systems and homomorphic encryption schemes. 

I also have broad interests in the theoretical foundations of cryptographic proofs.
